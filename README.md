# OptimalTic - Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

OptimalTic is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using **Jetpack Compose** with AI-powered gameplay based on the **Minimax Algorithm**. The game provides multiple modes, including **Normal**, **Impossible**, and **Multiplayer**. 🤖✨

## Features 🚀

- **Single Player Mode** 🎭
  - **Normal Mode**: AI makes mistakes occasionally, allowing a fair challenge. 🤔
  - **Impossible Mode**: AI is unbeatable, using the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves. 💡
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Play with a friend on the same device. 👥
- **Sleek UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern and smooth user experience. 🎨
- **Optimized AI**: Uses the Minimax algorithm for strategic decision-making. 🧠

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Kotlin** - Primary programming language 🏗️
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern UI toolkit 🎭
- **Minimax Algorithm** - AI for Impossible mode 🤖
- **Clean and MVVM Architecture** - Clean architecture and MVVM for better maintainability 📌

## How to Play 🎲

1. Choose a game mode:
   - **Normal** (AI with random moves) 😃
   - **Impossible** (Unbeatable AI) 🏆
   - **Multiplayer** (Two players on the same device) 👫
2. Play by tapping on an empty cell to mark **X** or **O**. ❌⭕
3. The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full (draw). 🎉
4. Restart the game to play again. 🔄

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfrenDialsa/OptimalTic.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**. 💻
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device. 📱

## Minimax Algorithm 🤖

The **Minimax algorithm** is implemented to ensure optimal gameplay in **Impossible Mode**:
- AI evaluates all possible moves and picks the one that maximizes its chances of winning. 🔍
- Uses recursion to explore possible future states. 🔄
- Implements pruning techniques for performance optimization. ⚡
